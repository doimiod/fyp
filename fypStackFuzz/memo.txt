• deal with exceptions in equivalence -> i have to report the error i think?
-- make an exception for stackInt2 by myself - done
• restrict the domain of integer values done - done
• understand how to limit the number of calls to the test function that fuzz testing is doing
• find a way to stop testing when one difference is found
• find a way to try catch exception

i found it stopped somehow but i cant limit by my own
it says 
Fuzzing stopped due to guidance exception: Too many trials without coverage; likely all assumption violations

i have to make another array to diceide cases
